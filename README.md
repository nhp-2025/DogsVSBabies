# Dogs vs. Babies: Who Uses the Westside Trail More? :smile:

This was my first completed project for the Lede Program at Columbia School of Journalism. On the Westside Trail in Atlanta’s West End neighborhood, I’ve observed alot of dogs and babies, and thought it might be interesting to track my observations and compare them to any available data. 

First, I determined a regular walking path, and mapped its coordinates along with that of the broader Westside Trail just to visualize them both against the backdrop of a neighborhood map. 

Then I gathered my daily observations and uploaded this dataset to Datawrapper for a visualization.

Using the geojson coordinates for my walking path, I learned that it was part of 
Block Group 1, Census Tract 62, Fulton County, Georgia, according to the U.S. Census, which provides population data for the area. 

I used Scrollama to build the scrollytelling site.
